"During most of the Golden Age, the humans who inhabited the Great Continent "
"were mostly Wesnothians, divided across various territories such as the "
"Northlands, Elensefar and the kingdom of Wesnoth itself. However, there was "
"once a time of great strife during which a new race of humans started to "
"appear from nowhere. They were the 'Aragwaithi', which meant 'noble' in "
"their native language.\n"
"\n"
"It has been since then rumored that they came from the Vast Sea to settle in "
"Wesnoth. They mostly lived as mercenaries in that time, until the Fall. "
"After that, they supposedly moved to the northmost lands of the Continent, "
"were the sands could not reach, and the green could survive.\n"
"\n"
"Albeit being humans, many of their customs and racial features are "
"incredibly different to the standards, to the point it puts them close to "
"elves in terms of their dexterity with bows. Their wisemen have a mastery of "
"magic not to be underestimated in the battlefield, for it has surprised and "
"overseded the best magi often."

"The humans of the Khalifate are regular ones, proud and sturdy, but have not "

"Few is known to the cartographers of Wesnoth south of the Aethenwoods and "
"only one known living, an Elf named Eliel, have ever travelled towards the "
"Khalifate and come back. He spout about forests so thick that the sun cannot "
"reach the ground, waste deserts greater than the ocean and mountains that "
"touch the sky. Nobody believed him.\n"
"\n"

"The Khalifate are a semi-nomadic folk who occasionally found trading cities "
"at the cost or send caravans through the desert for contacting their "
"neighbours, but mostly hale in various small tribes scattered across the "
"country only unified together by the Khalif of Tyrkyeh.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Legends'</header>\n"
"In the beliefs of those nomads the world is ruled by two primordial forces "
"in perpetual war and perfect symbiosis: Light and Darkness. While night and "
"death are to be feared, they are not evil and neither faction can, or "
"should, ever triumph. Every member of the Khalifate choose their following "
"path joining one of the forces.\n"
"\n"
"Legends passed down through many generations do speak of a time when there "
"was a great evil. The name of this evil has been forgotten, for the older "
"generations were reluctant to utter it. The evil was motivated by neither "
"chaos nor death, but rather the complete annihilation of all. Both forces of "
"the world united to defeat this evil, splitting it into two components much "
"like they themselves were divided.  One half was a cold, lifeless, and "
"listless force that bore a strong resemblance to death. The other half was "
"passionate and full of life, but lacked direction and was much weakened "
"without the cold logic of the other half. The enemy was now split into "
"components that fit within the understanding of the world; it was of this "
"world, and could not carry out its original mission.\n"
"\n"
"Eventually, one day a faction will arouse victorious and annihilate the "
"other and itself in the process."

"\n"
"The Dark Elves have lived in the silent blackness for eons, adapting to a "
"world into which they were cast. They added to their knowledge of the arcane "
"arts, the dark ones. And through this they have wrought a thriving "
"underground society full of armies, cities, and a ruling queen.\n"
"\n"
"They live in shadows, content to be ignored by the world of light above "
"them, in fact, it is not even sure if they know it.\n"
"Only the Dwarves, and some more obscure cave creatures, have knowledge of "
"them, by sending scouting parties deep into the caves in search of gold, "
"shiny stones, sturdy metals. Quickly droved, but few returned to their great "
"halls unscathed. Those that did spout incoherent babble, and amongst their "
"words were always talk of strange Clerics of the Night, torturing their "
"chosen victims to death, only to restore them back to life.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='History'</header>\n"
"Long after the Fall, when the suns dried out the marches and the forests "
"diminished, every man or beast was on his own. The Trolls budded deeper into "
"the ancients mountains, the dwarves retreated themselves into long forgotten "
"reigns, the orcs hided into muddy holes and undead roamed the known lands.\n"
"\n"
"While the elfes, well, slowly they had gain an affinity with the vast "
"deserts that spread out in this new era. Even forgetting most of their "
"ancestors memories or misinterpreting them, they lived in peace despite "
"lacking the skills or civilisation's acknowledgements of their foregoing "
"being known afterwards as 'the Quenoth Elfs'.\n"
"\n"
"But not all stayed at the surface and fought a desperate fight against "
"destiny, some elfes, overcoming their own fear of darkness and the "
"underground, fled deep inside the mountains of Irdya. In the beginning, life "
"was treacherous and dangerous into the depths, and many civilians have "
"perished to the unknown foes of the underworld. But with time, strength was "
"born and those elfs forged a labyrinthine tunnels, a waste empire, whose "
"centre was the magnificent elfish capital of Valinor, carved directly out "
"the rocks with the natural elfish craftsmanship.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"They divide into separate houses, and thus were their lords were chosen, "
"each of it commanded by a noble and guided by a cleric.\n"
"\n"
"They tend to lurking the ever deeps waiting for prey or training fiercely "
"with the cold steel in hand to prepare themselves to any upset that may come "
"enjoying mocking whoever fell captive to them.\n"
"\n"
"Studied both the arcane as natural arts, Dark Elfs are versatile mages and "
"powerful too.\n"
"\n"
"Tamed wild animals of the caves too such as lizards and bats, who prove "
"their valour in any battle they enter, serving especially as quick scouts "
"that turn around their enemies, annoying them and distracting them preparing "
"the real assault of the warriors.\n"
"\n"
"When affronted in their home caves, they are surely a fierce enemy that is "
"not a light tread. Especially with the dwarves they had developed a "
"'special' relationship, and those races will certainly fight until dead when "
"ever they see.\n"
"\n"
"But outside, against the land dwellers, they quickly will perish especially "

"\n"
"Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with stocky legs, shaggy hair "
"and strong claws. They are typically solitary and diurnal, living on almost "
"every part of the Great Continent in the wilderness.\n"
"\n"
"They are aided by an excellent sense of smell, and despite their heavy build "
"and awkward gait, they can run quickly and are adept climbers and swimmers; "
"digging, smashing, tearing and catching prey with their sharp claws.\n"
"\n"
"They are physically powerful and are likely capable of fatally attacking any "
"soldier, but, for the most part, are shy, easily frightened and will avoid "
"settlements. Although injuries caused by bears are definitely not a light "
"wound, their danger is often vastly exaggerated, in part by the human "
"imagination. However, when a mother feels her cubs are threatened, she will "
"behave ferociously.\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to give all bears a wide berth because they are "
"behaviourally unpredictable."
