"Greetings, translators! If you are reading this, you should be warned that\n"
"translating this campaign will most certainly not be an easy task. A few "
"things\n"
"to keep in mind:\n"
"\n"
" * The 1.10 and 1.11/1.12 versions of the campaign are identical, using\n"
"   conditional code to keep compatibility for both versions. You should\n"
"   translate only ONE version of the campaign and then ask the WesCamp admin"
"(s)\n"
"   to copy the strings over to the other version.\n"
"\n"
" * Especially later on, there are many non-visual cues indicating the mood "
"of a\n"
"   scene or a line as spoken by a character. While reading the WML or "
"playing\n"
"   the campaign helps, there are also many gettext comments scattered "
"through\n"
"   to help with this. If you are using poedit or similar, you should be "
"able\n"
"   to see the comments or annotations attached to a particular line "
"(msgid),\n"
"   as well as the source file path(s) and line number(s).\n"
"\n"
" * Many lines are deliberately vaguely worded in the English original. You "
"may\n"
"   find relevant comments or annotations, or you may ask in the campaign "
"topic\n"
"   in the Wesnoth forums for help.\n"
"\n"
" * Only COMPLETE translations will be included with the campaign. You "
"should\n"
"   notify the maintainer in the campaign’s topic once your translation is\n"
"   listed as such in http://gettext.wesnoth.org/.\n"
"\n"
"Have fun!"

"Long before the arrival of humans, the ancient Argazar civilization "
"dominated Irdya. However, they lost a war with the world of Rythé, and found "
"themselves close to complete obliteration. But with their great mastery of "
"technology they were able to create the ultimate weapon: the "
"‘biomechanicals’, known in their ancient tongue as ‘Shaxthals’. These "
"invincible legionnaires combined the best and most lethal attributes of "
"every creature known by their creators. They served as protectors to the "
"Argazars, but could not guard them against Rythénian strategic weapons. The "
"Rythé desolated the lands of Irdya, destroyed the cities, and buried the "
"works of the Argazars.\n"
"\n"
"A remnant of the Argazars survived, buried deep in the very underground base "
"where shaxthal production was centered. The Rythénians thought their race "
"was gone, and abandoned Irdya putting an end to the war. No one knows what "
"events took place on the surface during the following eons, as the shattered "
"ecology of Irdya reknit itself. But what is known, is that the Argazars’ "
"creations rebelled against their masters. Whether this was due to a change "
"in the shaxthal creatures or the remaining Argazars themselves is not "
"known.\n"
"\n"
"Without the direction of the Argazars, the instincts of the Shaxthals "
"prevailed. Their drives were a strange and predatory mixture of those of "
"their biological ancestors and the warfare programming of their artificial "
"bodies. Those instincts drove them to consume the remains of the Argazar "
"civilization. Eventually they took the Argazars’ bodies and integrated them "
"into their own biomechanical plan. For they had been designed with an "
"assimilation system that allowed them to integrate into new environments, or "
"adapt the environments themselves to suit their needs, including any living "
"organisms that might inhabit them.\n"
"\n"
"The Shaxthals kept most of the technology of the Argazars, losing magic and "
"the advanced forms of biologic manipulation with which they had been "
"created. Reduced to barely a few dozen, the Argazars figured out a "
"biological weakness of their creations, a way to destroy most of the "
"Shaxthals en masse. All but a few of the strongest creatures perished. "
"Fatefully, the Argazars decided to keep them in cryogenic pods instead of "
"destroying them forever, as they thought there might be a last hope of using "
"reprogrammed shaxthals to rebuild their civilization at some point in the "
"future.\n"
"\n"
"That foolish thought condemned the Great Continent to an armageddon many "
"eons later.\n"
"\n"
"Long after the Fall of Wesnoth, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Chaos figured "
"out a way to resurrect the creatures, and reproduce their technology by "
"artificial means. The lorekeepers of the Empire even enabled them to them "
"able to rapidly reproduce by their own means. Thus modified, they became the "
"principal and most dreaded weapon of the Chaos Empire. After the defeat of "
"the Emperor, the Shaxthals were freed from their imprisonment in the dark "
"hives of the Heart, and adapted to the time-renewed ecology of the surface "
"world. They then began to prey on the speaking peoples of Irdya."
