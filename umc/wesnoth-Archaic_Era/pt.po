"The Primevals had never really mastered magic to the extent that the modern "
"races have.  However, they did figure ways to harness it for a power source, "
"and were able to easily mine and forge metals, fertilizers, and reactive "
"chemicals; resources were unlimited.  Many of the modern races would have "
"simply enjoyed a population explosion, but the austere Primeval culture led "
"to something else.  Many biological and mechanical feats of engineering were "
"the result.  The downside of the rapid development was that the "
"technological advances were uneven (roads, guns, aeroplanes, and many other "
"things had simply never been imagined) and they all rested upon a power "
"source no one understood:  magic.\n"

"The Primeval social order is very rigid, but merit-based.  The leaders are "
"near god-like in their physical strength and prowess, but do not simply rule "
"through a strong arm and stone heart.  Treachery to another Primeval is one "
"of the most dishonourable acts one can engage in, so while all subordinates "
"look upon their superiors with fear, they know those superiors have earned "
"their rank and will neither betray nor toy with them.  The result is a "
"disciplined and efficient military force, but the society lacks creativity "
"and can become too focussed upon narrow goals.\n"
"\n"
"As a result of both the rigid meritocracy and the abundance of resources, "
"the Primevals lost whatever tendancy toward division of the sexes they ever "
"had.  In general, the roles requiring strength fall to the males while roles "
"requiring endurance fall to the females, but either sex can become a leader "
"and both sexes are expected to engage in combat."

"<header>text='Legends'</header>\n"
"According to South-Seas beliefs, the struggle of the gods roughly falls into "

"Legends passed down through many generations do speak of a time when there "
"was a great evil.  The name of this evil has been forgotten, for the older "
"generations were reluctant to utter it.  The evil was motivated by neither "
"chaos nor death, but rather the complete annihilation of all.  Aruyun, "
"Athtep, and all of the gods of the world united to defeat this evil, "
"splitting it into two components much like they themselves were divided.  "
"One half was a cold, lifeless, and listless force that bore a strong "
"resemblance to death.  The other half was passionate and full of life, but "
"lacked direction and was much weakened without the cold logic of the other "
"half.  The enemy was now split into components that fit within the "
"understanding of the world; it was of this world, and could not carry out "
"its original mission.  There is always a fear that the two parts could re-"
"unite, but most modern South-Seafarers do not really believe these tales."
