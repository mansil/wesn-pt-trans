"The Primeval forces are beings from a time long, long ago. They share many "
"traits of the modern races, it is possible that they are ancestors.\n"
"<header>text='History'</header>\n"
"In their time, they were engaged in an exceptionally grim war with an enemy "
"both powerful and mysterious.  The enemy was defeated, but the devastation "
"to the world was severe and many Primeval leaders decided it best to go into "
"a form of suspended animation.\n"
"\n"
"Ages later, the Primevals re-emerged and encountered the modern races.  All "
"differences might have been overcome, but approximately 50 years after the "
"Primeval re-emergance came a plage.\n"
"\n"
"A strange disease of the soul and mind broke out, and denizens of the world "
"became something else - something that called itself Khthon.  As all other "
"races fell victim to the Khthon, the Primevals rose in strength, for they "
"were immune.  In the ensueing war against the Khthon, the Primevals "
"developed a distrust and hatred of all other races, for any of their member "
"could be Khthon infiltrator.\n"
"\n"
"Records of how the war was resolved are lost, but ultimately we know it was "
"the younger races who had triumphed.  Many of the Primevals had foreseen "
"this, and had once again gone into suspended animation within their aging "
"facilities.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Technology'</header>\n"
"The Primevals had never really mastered magic to the extent that the modern "
"races have.  However, they did figure ways to harness it for a power source, "
"and were able to easily mine and forge metals, fertilizers, and reactive "
"chemicals; resources were unlimited.  Many of the modern races would have "
"simply enjoyed a population explosion, but the austere Primeval culture led "
"to something else.  Many biological and mechanical feats of engineering were "
"the result.  The downside of the rapid development was that the "
"technological advances were uneven (roads, guns, aeroplanes, and many other "
"things had simply never been imagined) and they all rested upon a power "
"source no one understood:  magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"The Primeval social order is very rigid, but merit-based.  The leaders are "
"near god-like in their physical strength and prowess, but do not simply rule "
"through a strong arm and stone heart.  Treachery to another Primeval is one "
"of the most dishonourable acts one can engage in, so while all subordinates "
"look upon their superiors with fear, they know those superiors have earned "
"their rank and will neither betray nor toy with them.  The result is a "
"disciplined and efficient military force, but the society lacks creativity "
"and can become too focussed upon narrow goals.\n"
"\n"
"As a result of both the rigid meritocracy and the abundance of resources, "
"the Primevals lost whatever tendancy toward division of the sexes they ever "
"had.  In general, the roles requiring strength fall to the males while roles "
"requiring endurance fall to the females, but either sex can become a leader "
"and both sexes are expected to engage in combat."
