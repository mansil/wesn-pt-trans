"(sigh) It's an old school legend. The legend is that a certain group of "

"In their research, it seems, they came perilously close to the darker forms "
"of magic, blending it with their school magic. Being gifted with "
"extraordinary cleverness, however, they were able to avoid detection from "
"the masters. One of the products of these excursions was the Icestone. This "
"magical stone could channel the wielder's own powers of sorcery to generate "
"icy blasts. The most powerful of the magi could even control blizzards, and "
"make it snow in summer. It's possible the Stone's power may even extend "
