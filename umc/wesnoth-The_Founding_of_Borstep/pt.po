"In the year 9YW, orcs were new to the Great Continent, but when the tribe "
"ruled by Pash-Grod made landfall, the Wesnothians had already learned to "
"fear orcish brutality. The inhabitants of one settlement presented the orcs "
"with gold and promised to find more if they were allowed to live. Pash-Grod "
"accepted their bribe and moved his people away from the crowded coast. As "
"they went, Pash-Grod offered the same arrangement to other humans because he "
"had grown fond of gold and wanted to increase the size of his collection. Of "
"course he wasn't sharing, and the other members of his tribe could not see "
"any benefit to leaving humans unmolested. Some grumbled, but not too loudly."

"The tribe followed trails of their people around the Heart Mountains and "
"then north, but they found that much of the territory was already claimed by "
"other orcs. Pash-Grod didn't want trouble with his own race, so they kept "
"moving north until finally they found a home in a cave with a small forest "
"nearby. Pash-Grod settled down and sent wolf riders south to collect more "
"treasure from the humans. As they filled their cave, and the corners became "
"packed with filth, many orcs wondered aloud why they hadn't settled in one "
"of the nicer areas they had passed. The grumbling got louder until everyone "
"knew that a new leader would have the support of the tribe. It was just a "
"question of which clan was going to challenge Pash-Grod first...."
