"These spawns of night are not ones to be taken lightly or underestimated. "
"Although weak under the suns’ light, the cover and protection of darkness "
"allows them to kill beings of greater size and strength then themselves "
"quite easily. This, combined with their high resistance to physical damage, "
"makes them enemies that only beings skilled in magical arts should attempt "
"to destroy."

"These creatures, known to those who encounter them as Shadow Spawns, are an "
"embodiment of the darkest magical arts, and as such, only those highly adept "
"in the arts of necromancy can create them. Like some undead, they possess "
"the necromantic ability to raise the corpses of those they kill to the cruel "
"world of unlife, and are willing to use this to full advantage."

"Sometimes the mightiest warriors and generals, cursed with hate and angst, "
"come back to this world as Death Knights. Death Barons serve them whilst "
"accruing enough unholy power to advance to the level of their masters. In "
"the process, they pick up a good deal of the Knight’s skills, including the "
"ability to easily and effectively command underlings."

"The horsemen with the most experienced rose quickly through the ranks, only "

"great, and, in death as in life, novice units should not attempt to do "

"These mounted skeletons were once great warriors thundering across the "
"plains. In life, they had not yet acquired the skill and strength of the "
"more experienced of their ranks, but they were equal in terms of speed; they "
"could dash into battle as fast as those more experienced. This is still "
"apparent even now, trapped in unlife as they are to spread fear and "
"destruction. Novice fighters should have no problem fighting these, but need "
"remember the speed of the skeletal mounts."
