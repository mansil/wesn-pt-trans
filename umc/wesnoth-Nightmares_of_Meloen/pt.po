"Fate can be treacherous at times, as quick to offer you a present as to turn "
"it into a burden. When Meloen succeeded in brushing the knowledge of magic's "
"origin with the tip of her mind during a short burst of supreme lucidity, "
"she fused with her environment, against all odds. But her innate insecurity "
"led to ever greater self-doubt and she speculated that luck only was "
"responsible for these events, and not her determination and work. Indeed, "
"she came to believe that misfortune toyed with her life, amusing itself by "
"putting her in a nightmare.\n"
"Black cats are simple forest creatures that have turned into hideous "
"chimeras through Meloen's dark thoughts. Although no one knows what kind of "
"magic is behind their power, it seems that any creature that crosses their "
"evil eyes is struck by misfortune."
